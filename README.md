For quantitative comparison, we summarize the root mean squared tracking error $\boldsymbol e_\text{RMSE}$ and maximum error $\boldsymbol e_\text{max}$ of these three methods at the steady state in Table 1. Especially, we also compare the performance of these methods in the presence of time-varying noise. It can be seen that the errors achieved by our method are much smaller than those achieved by existing two methods in both the noise-free and the noise-polluted cases, which reveals the accuracy of our method
